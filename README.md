# Yoga-Pose-Classification-Project

## Introduction
Welcome to the Yoga Pose Detection and Classification project! This repository contains the source code, documentation, and resources for our project aimed at developing a system capable of detecting and classifying yoga poses from images or videos. Whether you're a developer, researcher, or yoga enthusiast, we invite you to explore, contribute, and collaborate on this exciting endeavor.

## About the Project
Yoga is a centuries-old practice known for its physical, mental, and spiritual benefits. With the increasing popularity of yoga and advancements in computer vision technology, there's an opportunity to leverage machine learning and image processing techniques to assist practitioners in improving their yoga practice.
The goal of this project is to develop an automated system that can accurately detect and classify yoga poses from various input sources, such as images captured from cameras or frames extracted from videos. By analyzing body postures and alignments, the system aims to provide real-time feedback, alignment corrections, and personalized recommendations to practitioners, enhancing their yoga experience and progression.
